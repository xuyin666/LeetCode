// 501. Find Mode in Binary Search Tree


// Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates,
// find all the mode(s) (the most frequently occurred element) in the given BST.
// Assume a BST is defined as follows:
// The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
// The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
// Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
