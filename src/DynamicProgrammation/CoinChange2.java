// 518. Coin Change 2
// You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations
// and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.
//
// Return the number of combinations that make up that amount.
// If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return 0.
//
// You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
// The answer is guaranteed to fit into a signed 32-bit integer.
